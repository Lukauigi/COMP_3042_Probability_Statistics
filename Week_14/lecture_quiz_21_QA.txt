A network administrator suspects that the servers are running slowly 
and that the mean amount of time to transfer a 10MB file is greater 
than the benchmark mean transfer time of 5 seconds. He decides to 
conduct a hypothesis test with significance α, and if he finds 
sufficient evidence that his suspicion is correct, then he will 
allocate more server space. However, he really doesn't want to 
allocate more server space if he doesn't have to. That is: if the 
mean transfer time isn't actually greater than 5 seconds, he wants 
it to be very unlikely that his hypothesis test leads him to 
conclude that it was.

What type of error is the network administrator trying to avoid, 
and how can he reduce the chance of making it?

A: Type I; reduce α
